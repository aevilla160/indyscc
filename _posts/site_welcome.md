We are currently seeking highly motivated students at the University of California, Merced to be a part of the upcoming supercomputing competition, [IndySCC](https://sc25.supercomputing.org/students/indyscc/).


The IndySCC takes the form of a multi-phase competition, that allows for students from various backgrounds to learn and work with a High Performance Computing Environment. This culminates in a final **hybrid** 48 hour competition that coincides with the SC'25 conference.

Under the supervision of Professor Xiaoyi Lu, the students will work collaboratively and rigorously to learn key concepts in the area of HPC, machine learning, scientific computing and parallel computing.
